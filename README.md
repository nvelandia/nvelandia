<h1>Hey! I'm Nicolas Velandia</h1> 


I'm a Full-stack developer. Right now I'm searching my first job at the IT world.  :detective:

I'm from Colombia, but since 2017 I've been living in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Here, I found the passion for the technological advance, and I wanted to be part of it.  <br>
So I started my way in this world. This year after I learning for myself, I decide to enter the HENRY academy, startup of development world.  :rocket:   <br>
:man_student:  I studied web development full stack Javascript. I've had the chance to immerse myself in some projects to improve my code and design.

I want to continue learning, improving my skills and my code of course to be part of technological development, because I believe that the future of world is in the hands of the developers. :computer:

Thank you for reading.
